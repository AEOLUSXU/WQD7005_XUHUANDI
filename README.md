Case Study: Analysis of E-commerce Customer Behavior

Goal:
This case study aims to analyze e-commerce customer behavior to provide insights into customer churn and support business strategy development. We used a dataset from Kaggle, which contains multiple features related to customer behavior.

Tools and methods:
SAS Enterprise Miner (e-Miner):
In this project, SAS Enterprise Miner was used to build a data mining model, with a focus on decision tree analysis and clustering techniques.
The decision tree model helps us understand the predictive factors of customer churn and identifies key features.
In addition, we also used ensemble methods such as random forest and gradient boosting to improve the accuracy and generalization ability of the model.

Talent Data Prep:
Talent Data Prep is used for data preprocessing, including handling missing values and data cleaning.
We applied transformation rules, standardized and normalized data to ensure data quality and analyzability.

The data source is only one file, so Talent Data Integration was not used

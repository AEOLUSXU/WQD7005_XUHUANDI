Dataset used:
The data set used in this analysis comes from Kaggle.
It can be accessed via this Google Drive link.
This dataset was chosen because it contains comprehensive characteristics related to customer behavior in an e-commerce environment, and Kaggle's dataset can be used in data science research and analysis in a legal and compliant manner.

Code and scripts:
Use Talend Data Prep (DP) for data cleaning:
Scripts for handling missing values and initial data cleaning.
The applied transformation rules are used to standardize and normalize the data.
Data mining models in SAS Enterprise Miner (e-Miner):
Decision tree model script for analyzing customer behavior. Includes scripts for ensemble methods such as random forest and gradient boosting to improve prediction accuracy.

SAS Enterprise Miner:
Detailed documentation for building data mining models.
Emphasis is placed on decision tree analysis and clustering techniques.

Results and analysis:
Model output, including decision trees, ensemble models, and ROC curves.
Data integration logs and data quality reports.
Visualization and in-depth analysis of the results highlight key predictors of customer churn, such as age, total spend, and product pricing.
Customer behavioral insights, specifically differences in churn patterns between older and younger customers.

Reflection and learning outcomes:
Insights gained from the project highlight the importance of comprehensive data preprocessing and the effectiveness of ensemble approaches versus single models.
Challenges encountered, such as handling missing data and integrating disparate data sources, and methods adopted to overcome them.
